      <p style="color:green">Galileo was a astronomer in the 15 hundred. even though Galileo did not explore areas he did explore many things.  Galileo explored medicine in his first year of college later on he moved on to mathamtics and physics but we are going to talk about his exploration of space in 1604 galileo started working on his Copernican theory that the earth and planets revolved around the sun it was 1609 when galileo hered of the first tellescope when he hered about the telliscope it was made by a dutch glassmaker. He stared makeing his own. 
    Some  Venetian merchants caught intress in the new thing that was like a telliscope but not as strong. The merchants bought some from galileo. Galileo stared working harder to make a stronger telliscope and point it into the sky he discoverd that the moon is not flat and smooth but rather a sphere and was not smooth. Galileo also had found that venus has phases like the moon and jupiter has 3 moons that dont  revolve around the earth. Galileo soon stared finding clues to suport his Copernican theory </p>
